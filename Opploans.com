A small personal loan usually leads folks to think about payday or cash advance loans. These extraordinarily high-interest loans are meant to tide you over until the next payday. Unfortunately, payments on these loans become a budget item for months and months, costing hundreds in interest for many.

Other folks think of a loan or line of credit at around $10,000 or below. These are thought of as relief from increased credit card debt or other types of spending drags on the budget. They are far cheaper than credit card debt.

For some, these loans are hard to get, especially when faced with a shady credit history. With poor or no credit, most lenders want some form of substantial collateral as security on the loan. But, for those with good credit, many lenders are available that offer small, personal loans that offer interest rates so low that they are unknown in the credit card industry.
